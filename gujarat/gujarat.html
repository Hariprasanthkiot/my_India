            <h2>1.RANN OF KUTCH</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 130%;"> There’s a saying that goes in Gujarat. “Kutch Nahin dekha to kuchh nahin dekha” which translates to “you haven’t seen anything if you haven’t seen Kutch.” Kutch is the deserving top desination to visit in Gujarat especially when the Rann Mahotsav is in full swing.
                Wedged between the Arabian Sea and the boundless Thar Desert, Rann of Kutch is mesmerizing symphony of salt and sand. This white symphony reaches its crescendo on a full moon night. What makes Kutch even more surreal is that during the monsoon, it gets submerged in the water. </p>
