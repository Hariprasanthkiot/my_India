Dudhsagar Falls is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m and an average width of 30 metres. The falls is located in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park among the Western Ghats. The falls is a punctuation mark in the journey of the Mandovi River from the Western Ghats to Panjim where it meets the Arabian sea. The area is surrounded by deciduous forests with rich biodiversity. This waterfall is also known as Tambdi Surla to some of the local people. The falls are not particularly spectacular during the dry season but during the monsoon season, however, the falls are fed by rains and form a huge force of water.</p>           <div class="yercaudimage">

                IN THE JUNGLE YOUR SENSES COME ALIVE, DRUM BEATS CUT THROUGH THE SILENCE AND FLAMES LIGHT UP THE NIGHT SKY, COLUMNS OF OLD WITH A FUTURISTIC VIEW, DANCING WITH NATURE AND A MIND BENDING CREW. THIS IS CLUBBING.EVOLVED.
            Leopard Valley was born in 2013 when Subnation Stageworks came across a hidden gem in a jungle quarry. Overgrown and battered by monsoon, Clint Hale had a vision for the venue and quickly got his partner Peter Smith on board. Together with the owner they shared the vision and set to work making it become a reality...........designing a bespoke stage that would fit in with the look and natural elements of the venue, then bringing the "famous" columns to their new home. The columns would have a pyrotechnics makeover - each of them shooting fire out the top and creating a spectacular vibe.When the stage was finished it stood 7 meters above the crowd complete with waterfall and its own raised dance floor. Now add lasers, lights, performers, DJ's and a massive sound system and the dream is coming to life. The philosophy of Subnation Stageworks is always ground breaking production and shows, to amaze the crowd and take them into an experience like no other.The Venue can hold 3,000 people, open air under the stars, set way back from the road and villages, its a magical location with a very unique atmosphere

            <h2>4.Butterfly Beach</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 130%;">As the name suggests, Butterfly beach is the abode of numerous beautiful butterflies. But what the name doesn't tell us is that during low tides, when the seashore widens, the beach is littered with crabs and goldfishes. Sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and even redfish are common sights here."Why is Butterfly Beach called so?"
                The Butterfly beach is a secluded beach, where you can reach by a boat from the Palolem beach. The beach is named "Butterfly" because of its shape which is similar to a butterfly. The boat journey to this place is amazing. You can also spot some Dolphins on the route to this beach.A little to the south of Palolem in Cancona region of Goa lies the Butterfly Beach. This beach, also known as Honeymoon Beach, is in the form of a small cove surrounded by dense trees.</p>
